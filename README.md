# Twitter-Full-Archive-Search
This code will search the full Twitter archive for tweets containing the word "twitter" that were posted between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2022, and retrieve up to 100 tweets. You can customize the search query and other parameters to meet your specific needs.

Note that you will need to obtain a bearer token and add it to the code in order to use the Twitter Researcher API.


If you want to scrape more than 10,000 tweets using the Twitter API, you will need to use the next field in the API response to paginate through the results. The next field contains a URL that you can use to retrieve the next set of tweets that match your search criteria.
